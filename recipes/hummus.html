    <h3>Hummus Description</h3>
    <p>Hummus, also spelled hommus or houmous, is a dip of Arab origin, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed
        chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. The standard garnish in the Middle East includes olive
        oil, a few whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked chickpeas, peeled (from 1 to 1 ¼ cup dry chickpeas or from quality canned chickpeas. See
            recipe notes for more instructions on cooking and peeling chickpeas) </li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3 to 4 ice cubes </li>
        <li>⅓ cup (79 grams) tahini paste </li>
        <li>2½ tsp kosher salt </li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon </li>
        <li>Early Harvest Greek extra virgin olive oil </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Add chickpeas and minced garlic to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until a smooth, powder-like mixture
            forms. </li>
        <li>While processor is running, add ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so.
            Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend
            until you reach desired silky smooth consistency. </li>
        <li>Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of Early Harvest EVOO. Add a few chickpeas to the
            middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Burger Description</h3>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
        a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped
        with cheese is called a cheeseburger. </p>
